# SSE
This is a library to implement server-sent events in a web application project. The library can be used to start a seperate dedicated http server which handels SSEs or can be used with your custom handlers with the axum web framework (I did not get it to work with other frameworks).

## Examples
```rust

```

## WARNING
- This is my _first_ rust project so this code is by no means stable and/or good! Feel free to modify it to suit your needs
- I will not accept pull requests because the amount of knowledge about rust that I have is not enough to correctly decide over your proposed changes
- There is a high chance that I will not maintain this library so use with care
