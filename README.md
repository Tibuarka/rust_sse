# SSE
This is a library to implement server-sent events in a web application project

## WARNING
- This is my _first_ rust project so this code is by no means stable and/or good! Feel free to modify it to suit your needs
- I will not accept pull requests because the amount of knowledge about rust that I have is not enough to correctly decide over your proposed changes
